      <p>What's with these homies, dissing my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?
Woo-hoo
But you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo
And I know you're mine
Woo-hoo
(And that's for all time)
Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care about that
Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian
Woo-hoo
And you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo
And I know you're mine
Woo-hoo
(And that's for all time)
Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care about that
I don't care about that
Bang, bang, a knock on the door
Another big bang and you're down on the floor
Oh no! What do we do?
Don't look now, but I lost my shoe
I can't run, and I can't kick
What's the matter babe, are you feeling sick?
What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter you?
What's the matter babe, are you feeling blue?
Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care about that
I don't care about that
I don't care about that
I don't care about that</p>
