          <h2>Me.</h2>
          <p>Class has been very fun for my time at Tech. There are so many
          opportunities from the 4 different classes in IT that you can
        choose from. I've learned things from hardware, cybersecurity, software,
      and programming. I play Trumpet and have been for 5 years. I am currently
      with the Northeastern Marching Band and their jazz ensemble. It's really
          fun. I am also in Boy Scouts and are a Star rank at the moment. I also
        like to play video games like Minecraft and am currently invested in
      Jedi: Fallen Order.</p>
